# Interview-Preparation
- Notes on various topics and interview questions 
Each &lt;article&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the &lt;article&gt; element.


- When an &lt;article&gt; element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be &lt;article&gt; elements nested in the &lt;article&gt; representing the blog post.

- Author information of an &lt;article&gt; element can be provided through the &lt;address&gt; element, but it doesn't apply to nested &lt;article&gt; elements.
The publication date and time of an &lt;article&gt; element can be described using the datetime attribute of a &lt;time&gt; element.
